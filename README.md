# flytsamples

These are sample scripts written using FlytAPIs in ROS, CPP, Python, RESTFull, WebSockets.

FlytOS abstracts drone autopilot's navigation, setup functions to a SBC(companion computer) in the form for FlytAPIs.
FlytOS uses ROS at its core and exposes APIs for non ros users as well.

To replicate above samples you need to install recent version of flytOS for your companion computer. 
Binaries are available to download at http://flytbase.com/flytos

You can try out your scripts in flytSIM (based on Px4 SITL) before putting them on actual drone. 
FlytSIM is available to download at http://flytbase.com/flytos/ 
Note that FlytSIM does not yet work on SBC with ARM arch. So you will have to install it on your laptop/desktop.

For hardware setup you can use Pixhawk + Odroid XU4. This link can help you out. http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/odroid-via-mavlink/
