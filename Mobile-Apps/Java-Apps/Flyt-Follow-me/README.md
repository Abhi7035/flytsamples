# Follow Me
This is a sample follow-me app using GPS based positioning. When follow-me mode is turned on, the GPS coordinates of the device running the app are used to send position commands to the drone and the drone follows the person carrying the device.

## Things to Remember

* The blue marker shows the location of the drone on the map.
* The blue dot shows the location of the mobile device.
* Click on the **follow on** button on the bottom of the screen for the drone to start following you.
* Please wait for the mobile device to get an accurate GPS location before the drone starts accepting the GPS location. You can put the device in High Accuracy location mode.
* Click on **follow off** to stop the drone from following.
* You can add an offset between the drone and the device position to make the drone follow it at desired distance. Click the **nudge** button on the left side of the screen (first button on the left).
* Keep in mind to stop follow before giving it Land command.
