# Flyt Android SDK
This SDK allows you to jump start your drone application development with flyt-android-library preintegrated.

You can download the SDK from [here](https://flyt.blob.core.windows.net/flytos/downloads/sdk/Flyt_Android_SDK.zip)

Please refer the [developer documenation](http://docs.flytbase.com/docs/FlytOS/Developers/BuildingCustomApps/RemoteMobile.html#write-remote-mobile) for instructions on building your app using the SDK.

## Things to Remember

* All required initialisation have already been made.
* You directly start buiding your app with required subscriptions and REST calls following the sample REST and Websocket calls already provided.
