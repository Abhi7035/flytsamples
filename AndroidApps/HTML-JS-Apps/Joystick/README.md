## Things to Remember

* You need to **takeoff** before you can use the joystick to control your drone.
* The left joystick gives the drone commands to move **up down turn-left and turn-right**.
* The right joystick gives the drone commands to move **front back left and right**.
* All the commands are given with respect to the drone(front = direction of the nose/front of the drone).
